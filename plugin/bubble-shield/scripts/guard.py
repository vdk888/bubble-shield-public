"""Bubble Shield guard — PreToolUse hook.

Reads the PreToolUse event JSON on stdin. If the tool is about to touch a file
inside a *protected* client folder, it DENIES the call (permissionDecision:
"deny") and tells Claude to run the data through Bubble Shield first.

Fail-closed by design:
  - a `deny` from a PreToolUse hook blocks the tool even under
    bypassPermissions / --dangerously-skip-permissions (per Claude Code docs);
  - if the config is missing/malformed, or anything goes wrong while deciding,
    we DENY rather than allow — a guard that fails open is no guard.

Pure stdlib. No import of the Bubble Shield engine here: the guard's only job is the
gate. Anonymisation itself is the `bubble-shield-anonymize` skill / the webapp.

Exit/΄output contract (Claude Code hooks):
  - print a JSON object with hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision and exit 0.

# --- Cowork sandbox-mount-alias handling (FIX B / FIX C) -----------------------

# to the session under a DYNAMIC per-session alias:
#     /sessions/<random-session-name>/mnt/<subpath>
# e.g. `/sessions/pensive-dreamy-goldberg/mnt/clients/note.txt`. The <session-name>
# is random per session (cannot be hardcoded). The HOST guard matches command
# strings against REAL Mac paths, so an alias token like the above resolves to no
# marker on the Mac (`/sessions/...` doesn't exist there) and the legacy needle
# scan (Mac-path needles only) never matches the alias prefix → the command was
# ALLOWED and PII leaked in clear. This is a mount-NAMESPACE mismatch, distinct
# from the cwd-exfil path-EXTRACTION fix.
#
# The mount exposes a protected folder's CONTENTS under `mnt/<basename>/…`, so a
# mount-relative path whose first segment is a protected folder's basename is
# INSIDE that protected folder → DENY (Fix B). Any *other* `mnt/<X>` token we
# can't classify is failed CLOSED (Fix C), EXCEPT the known Cowork infra mounts
# below, which are the agent's own workspace and must stay usable.

#   clients (in the probe) → the USER-SELECTED protected folder (Fix B denies it
#     via its basename anyway; it is NOT infra).
# We ALLOW these infra mounts so the fail-closed backstop (Fix C) doesn't brick

        #   COVERED by the PRIMARY walk-up (cwd-INDEPENDENT): any absolute/home path
        #     into a marked folder (the proven client exfil shape).
        #   COVERED by the PRIMARY walk-up (cwd-anchored): any slash-bearing relative
        #     path (`Dupont/avis.jpg`) resolved against cwd that lands under a marker.
        #   COVERED by the needle scan: commands that literally name a discoverable
        #     marker root by its absolute path.
        #   RESIDUAL (deliberately ALLOWED): a BARE filename with no slash
        #     (`cat avis.jpg`) whose cwd is itself inside a marked folder. The
        #     resolved path WOULD be under a marker, but extracting "avis.jpg" as a
        #     path candidate is indistinguishable from extracting every bare word/
        #     subcommand/flag-value in the command — emitting all of them would
        #     either over-deny benign commands (`cat readme`, `make build`) or
        #     require a real shell lexer + per-arg cwd-join we don't have. We accept

        #     which would brick routine shell use (`ls`, `git status`). The exposure
        #     is small: it requires cwd to ALREADY be inside the protected folder
        #     (an agent that deep in the dossier is the in-folder workflow the marker
        #     governs, and the file-tool Read path covers the same files), and it
